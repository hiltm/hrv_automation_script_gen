# Overview
This repo contains python scripts used to generate text files using unique syntax for commands related to automated deployment of an MS-SID instrument. See hrv repo for the microcontroller gear related to that instrument.
# Building

# Installing

# Operating the Script
To use the script, run the generated program. 
The terminal will prompt for various inputs.
1. Not entering a value (e.g. hititng enter) will input a default value.
2. Not entering an integer (e.g. entering a letter or character) will prompt the user to continue retrying submissions until an integer is submitted.
Upon completion of the script a text file will be created at the path of the script.
This script can then be transferred to the SD card on the MS-SID microcontroller board to allow for autonomous control.
