This is CrossCut Version 1.0.1

When you first run CrossCut, it will request that you select a comm port for
communicating with the Tattletale Model 8. This selection will be stored in
the Windows Registry so it will be available the next time you start
CrossCut.

The following items are also saved in the Registry each time you exit CrossCut
and are retrieved the next time you start CrossCut:

* Comm Port setting - Port number, baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits
* Whether the port should be released when CrossCut is inactive or not.
* Whether a Line Feed should be automatically sent after sending a Carriage Return or not.
* The last directory used to load an S-Record
* The last S-Record file that was loaded.
* Main window settings - position, size and whether it was maximized or not.
* Whether the terminal should automatically append a Line Feed to a Carriage Return or not.
* Whether the terminal should automatically insert a Carriage Return before a Line Feed not.
* The name and directory of the Capture File.
* Whether new capture text should overwrite an existing file or append to it.
* Whether the terminal should wrap text or not.
* The font being used by the terminal.
* The Tab width being used by the terminal.
