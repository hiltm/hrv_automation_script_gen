This program is for clearing the flash EEPROM of the Tattletale Model 8.
It will clear all of flash EXCEPT for the TOM8 monitor. To use this program,
you must see the TOM8> prompt in CrossCut. If you don't see that but do
see the TxB# prompt, hit a Ctrl-X key combination and then answer 'Y' when
asked if you really want to exit to the monitor. If you can't get to the
monitor any other way, jumper IRQ3 to ground (that is, jumper pin A5 to A1
on the IO-8 board) and cycle the power on the Model 8. You should now see
the TOM8> prompt. Remove the jumper before continuing.

With the TOM8> prompt showing, choose 'Load' from the 'Tattletale' menu in
CrossCut. When the dialog box appears, find the file CLRFLASH.RHX and
load it. When TOM8 tells you it loaded successfully and you get another
prompt, just type 'G' and hit return. The program will run.

First you will be shown a map of the flash EEPROM in blocks of 256 bytes.
If a block is used, it is marked with an 'X'. If not used it is marked
with a period. You will be asked if you really want to clear flash. Answer
yes. You will see a status line showing percent complete. When it's done
you will be shown another map of flash with a lot more periods! Note that
the first prt of flash still has 'X' marks - this is the TOM8 monitor.

You can now re-load TxBASIC as you would normally.
